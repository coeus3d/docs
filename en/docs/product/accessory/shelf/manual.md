## Master Slave Machine Setting

![](images/master-slave.png)

Since it hard to control each individual device when using the multidevice screen, we use one master device to control all slave devices. 

Please follow the steps to set up master device.

1. Power on the devices and long press all `Mode` button of devices in the multidevice screen
    - Green light will be on
2. Choose Machine `0` as host. Double press the `Match` button
    - host machine will shine red light, and slave machine won't have any light on
3. Setup Finished

!!! note "Machine 0"
    `machine 0` is chose randomly, but usually, upper left one is chosen 

!!! note "Purple light"
    If `machine 0` is shining purple light, please refer to [FAQ](faq).
